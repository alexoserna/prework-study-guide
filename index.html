        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML indicates the role of the content and gives structure to the page.</li>
          <li>Div and Span would not be considered semantic HTML, but are useful for inline properties/content.</li>
          <li>Within the head element you would put the title and link elements to give the page a title and link the CSS stylesheet.</li>
          <li>Within the HTML tag you can adjust and set the default language for the page.</li>
          <li>Header elements (h1-h4) should be used in order and there should only be one h1 element at the beginning of the page.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Targetting multiple elements is possible by putting a comma after the first element then continuing to the second.</li>
          <li>Color, size, shape, font style, and background color can all be changed through the use of CSS.</li>
          <li>CSS can also be edited in the HTML instead of in a separate stylesheet.</li>
          <li>Classes and Id's are useful when selecting/targetting an element to edit.</li>
        </ul>
